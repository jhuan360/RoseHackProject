You are on the way to the lab and need to make sure you didn't forget any Personal Protection Equipment. What do you grab before leaving?
You rode your bicycle to the lab and are ready to head in for the experiment. Where do you put your bike?
While you do the experiment, you are handling various chemicals. How should you approach this?
You get thirsty and need to drink water. What do you do?
Your goggles fogged up so you took them off. As a result, chemicals splash into your eyes. How do you navigate through this issue?
Unfortunately, it doesn’t end here. As you wash your eye out someone accidentally trips and spills their chemicals all over you. How do you respond?
Now that you’ve washed off and know you’re safe, you decide to continue the lab with a new set of clothes and PPE. You notice that there are three bottoms for you to wear. Which do you choose?
You look to your left and notice someone eating Oreos. What do you do?
At this point, so much has gone on that you need to calm down. How do you settle your nerves?
In the process of calming down, you swiftly turn around to eavesdrop on a conversation taking place nearby and break a few of your beakers. How do you clean up the glass?
After the whole series of unfortunate events, you finally get back to the experiment and gain some momentum. You end up finishing and have to clean up. Where do you put the chemicals?
You are on the way out and notice your lab bench is filthy with all the previous events that unfolded. What is your final move?
